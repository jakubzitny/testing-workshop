# User testings

- motivation
  - manually verify components that are not tested automatically (unit, integration, e2e)
  - re-verify e2e tested app just to be sure
  - verify UX of app, understand how user "looks" at it ("you're not the user")
  - early stages, alpha / beta testing


- ux (usability) testings
  - experienced / novice users (representative to whatever goals we have)
  - controlled environment (in company, at home, neutral place, remote, [drunk](https://theuserisdrunk.com))
  - NOT market research
  - precisely prepared scenarios / test plans with expected outcomes/goals (not instructions)
    - don't explain
    - don't interrupt
    - don't draw attention to specific parts
    - don't judge
    - observe, clarify if needed
  - documentation (audio, video, screen recording)



- track
  - questionairre
  - benchmarks
  - eye tracking
  - online user behaviour (hotjar, smartlook, appcues) (review: lookback, usertesting, validately, usabilla)
  - A / B testing
